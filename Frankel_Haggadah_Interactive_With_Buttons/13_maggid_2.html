  <h2>Maggid – Part 2: The Cry of the People</h2>
  <div class="narrative">
    As the Israelites toiled, they cried out. Their groans rose up from the fields and brickyards and reached the heavens.
    “And God heard their groaning, and remembered the covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.” A cry, a covenant, and a turning point.
  </div>
  <div class="commentary">
    Sometimes we don't need to know what to pray — we only need to cry out. This is the moment our ancestors' pain was noticed — not because of eloquence, but because of truth.
