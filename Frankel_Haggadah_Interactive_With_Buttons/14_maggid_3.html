  <h2>Maggid – Part 3: Moses and the Call to Action</h2>
  <div class="narrative">
    Moses, raised in Pharaoh’s palace but born of Hebrew blood, fled Egypt after witnessing injustice.
    In the wilderness, God called to him from a burning bush: “I have seen the suffering of My people... now go. I will send you to Pharaoh.”
    Reluctant, unsure, and human — Moses accepted the call. Liberation always begins with someone saying yes, even in fear.
  </div>
  <div class="commentary">
    We imagine heroes as fearless. But Moses hesitated. He doubted. And still, he led. Courage isn't certainty — it’s commitment.
