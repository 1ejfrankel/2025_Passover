  <h2>Maggid – Part 4: Confronting Pharaoh</h2>
  <div class="narrative">
    Moses and Aaron stood before Pharaoh: “Let My people go.” Pharaoh refused — his heart was hardened.
    Again and again, they returned. And each time, Pharaoh dismissed them. But resistance was building.
    The God of their ancestors stood with the enslaved, and the empire would begin to crack.
  </div>
  <div class="commentary">
    Saying "no" to power is never easy. It takes repetition, resilience, and hope. Each confrontation became a seed of freedom.
