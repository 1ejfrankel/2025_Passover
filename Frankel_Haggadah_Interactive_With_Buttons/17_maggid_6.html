  <h2>Maggid – Part 6: Exodus and Pursuit</h2>
  <div class="narrative">
    Pharaoh finally relented. The Israelites fled — hurriedly, without time to let their bread rise.
    But no sooner had they gone than Pharaoh changed his mind. He gave chase, chariots thundering through the desert.
    The sea ahead, the army behind — trapped and terrified.

  <div class="commentary">
    Liberation is rarely a straight line. Fear doesn’t vanish just because the path opens. Sometimes freedom begins in panic and uncertainty.
