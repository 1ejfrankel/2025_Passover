  <h2>Maggid – Part 7: Splitting the Sea</h2>
  <div class="narrative">
    At the edge of the water, the people panicked. “Why did you bring us here to die?” they cried.
    Moses raised his staff — and the sea split. A path through the waters, dry ground beneath.
    The Israelites walked forward, surrounded by walls of water, not knowing what came next — only that they were moving.
  </div>
  <div class="commentary">
    Sometimes the only way through is through. Liberation often looks like stepping forward into the unknown — trusting the path will hold.
