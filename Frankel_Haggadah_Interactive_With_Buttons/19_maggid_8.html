  <h2>Maggid – Part 8: Freedom and Song</h2>
  <div class="narrative">
    On the far shore, safe at last, the Israelites sang. Miriam picked up her tambourine, and the women danced.
    The Song of the Sea echoed — “Horse and rider He has hurled into the sea.”
    It was not just a celebration of escape, but of transformation. Slaves no longer. A free people.
  </div>
  <div class="commentary">
    Singing was their first act as free people. Joy as resistance. Art as declaration. Dance as defiance.
