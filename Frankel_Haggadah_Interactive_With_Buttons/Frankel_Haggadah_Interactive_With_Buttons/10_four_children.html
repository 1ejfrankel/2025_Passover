  <h2>The Four Children</h2>

  <div class="section"><strong>Wise:</strong> Asks for the laws and details. We answer them with depth.</div>
  <div class="section"><strong>Wicked:</strong> Distances themselves — “What does this mean to you?” We remind them: you were there too.</div>
  <div class="section"><strong>Simple:</strong> Just asks, “What is this?” We answer simply: “With a mighty hand the Lord brought us out.”</div>
  <div class="section"><strong>One Who Doesn’t Know How to Ask:</strong> For this child, we open the door with stories and questions of our own.</div>

  <div class="commentary">
    This isn't a psychology test. It's a recognition that people ask differently — and that how we listen and respond is an act of care. Even the one who doesn’t ask deserves to be heard. And sometimes, we are each of these children in one night.
