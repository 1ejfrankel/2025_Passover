  <h2>Maggid – Part 1: The Rise of Pharaoh</h2>
  <div class="narrative">
    A new king arose over Egypt who did not know Joseph. Suspicious of the growing Israelite population, Pharaoh feared an uprising.
    He said to his people, "Behold, the Israelites are too numerous and strong for us. Let us deal wisely with them, or they may join our enemies in war."
    And so, oppression began — the Israelites were enslaved, their lives made bitter with hard labor in mortar and brick.
  </div>
  <div class="commentary">
    Every story of liberation begins with someone’s fear. Pharaoh was threatened by change and difference. That fear became cruelty — a caution for every generation.
